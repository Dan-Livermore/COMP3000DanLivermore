Is the dog showing signs of discomfort or abnormalities on the face?
├─ Yes: Proceed to the next question.
└─ No: Regular grooming and observation are recommended; note any changes in behavior or appearance.

What type of symptom is the dog displaying?
├─ Swelling:
│  ├─ Is the swelling localized to one area (e.g., around the eye, mouth, or cheek)?
│  │  ├─ Yes: Possible abscess, allergic reaction, or injury. Observe closely.
│  │  │  ├─ If accompanied by pain or heat: Likely infection or abscess. Consult a vet immediately.
│  │  │  └─ If no pain and not hot to the touch: Possible allergic reaction. Monitor for breathing difficulties and consult a vet if condition persists or worsens.
│  │  └─ No: If swelling is diffuse and not localized, possible systemic issue or severe allergic reaction. Seek veterinary care immediately.
├─ Wounds or Cuts:
│  ├─ Are there any visible wounds or cuts?
│  │  ├─ Yes: Clean with mild antiseptic and observe for signs of infection (redness, swelling, discharge).
│  │  │  ├─ If wound is deep or bleeding heavily: Consult a vet immediately.
│  │  │  └─ If wound is superficial: Keep clean and monitor for infection. If healing does not progress, see a vet.

└─ Discoloration or Dermatological Issues:
   ├─ Is there any change in skin color, or are there rashes or sores?
   │  ├─ Yes: Possible fungal infection, dermatitis, or auto-immune disease. Early veterinary consultation recommended.
   │  └─ No: If the skin looks healthy but the dog shows other symptoms like rubbing the face, consider less visible issues like dental pain.
   ├─ Does the dog have bad breath or difficulty eating?
   │  ├─ Yes: This could indicate dental issues, such as gum disease or tooth abscess. Veterinary dental examination is necessary.
   │  └─ No: Continue regular monitoring and maintain good dental hygiene.
